Codestyle guideline

For each of the components developed in this project, there should be at least 1 language/framework on which the sub-project is based; all of these shall have a separate Code Style template added to the related directory once the sub-project has been created so that future development processes could integrate static checkers and linters out-of-the-box.

Currently available code style templates:

1. Java & Java-based projects/modules -> project-dir/codestyle_templates/java_kotlin
2. Kotlin & Kotlin-based projects/templates
3. Swift & Swift-based projects/templates

Note:	This document should be updated with new code style templates whenever a framework gets added to the project/sub-projects.
